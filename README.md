# Commodity12 Artefact Identification Algorithms

## Description

A series of electrocardiogram (ECG) artefact identification algorithms for the [Zephyr BioHarness 3](http://zephyranywhere.com/products/bioharness-3/).

Written as part of a deliverable to the [Commodity12](http://commodity12.eu/) project by James Mardell &lt;[james.mardell@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:james.mardell@imperial.ac.uk)&gt; of [Imperial College London](http://keot.co.uk/).


## Directory Structure

### `./commodity12-artefact_sensing/`

A Java project for developing and testing the artefact identification algorithms before implementing them on the [Commodity12 SmartHub](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bodytel.android&hl=en).


### `./data/`

A series of old data records from the Zephyr BioHarness 3.


### `./matlab/`

A series of old MATLAB scripts to perform some analysis of the old data. These algorithms are documented in deliverable 3.2.


### `./profiling/`

A series of rewritten MATLAB scripts to perform the analysis featured in the deliverable report. Included with these files are some datasets featuring simulated ECG waveforms.
